# NeRF (in 100 lines of code) combined with EfficientKan

A tiny little test to see how KAN could work with a more complex computer vision task - Neural Radiance Fields.

To run the test I merged the [NeRF - Papers in 100 Lines of Code](https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code/tree/65b52864c6df3b4bfb77bc74ce922b7dfcfd07c8/NeRF_Representing_Scenes_as_Neural_Radiance_Fields_for_View_Synthesis) and [Efficient KAN](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan) code.

Test results are resulting...this is going to take a long time (LOL but also a lot of crying)
