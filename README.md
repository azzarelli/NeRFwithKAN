# NeRF + Kan = I don't know?

Let's see how KAN could work with a more complex computer vision task - Neural Radiance Fields.

To run the test I merged the [NeRF - Papers in 100 Lines of Code](https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code/tree/65b52864c6df3b4bfb77bc74ce922b7dfcfd07c8/NeRF_Representing_Scenes_as_Neural_Radiance_Fields_for_View_Synthesis) and [Efficient KAN](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan) code.

Test results are resulting...this is going to take a long time (LOL but also a lot of crying)


## Test Results:

(...running on a single GPU  - if I close my eyes I feel like I'm in an aeroplane going on holiday...)


## Running your own?
You can implement this by following the installation for [NeRF - Papers in 100 Lines of Code](https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code/tree/65b52864c6df3b4bfb77bc74ce922b7dfcfd07c8/NeRF_Representing_Scenes_as_Neural_Radiance_Fields_for_View_Synthesis). The only depedency you need to be worried about is pytorch.

If you are using KAN for NeRF for other project please loop me in! I would really like to see if KAN can be used for NeRF/Gaussian Splatting.
